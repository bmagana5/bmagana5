- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bmagana5
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in getting my skills to a level in which I can tackle impressive projects like creating and hosting a social media application where multiple users 
      can communicate, share content, and join communities with people who share common interests.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make fullstack web applications with React, Node.js, and MongoDB as well as some small Python applications.
